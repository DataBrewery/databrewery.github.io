Summary: Welcome Robin and Thanks to Squarespace

Before the upcoming 1.0 release, I would like to introduce 
[Cubes](http://cubes.databrewery.org) core developer [Robin
Thomas](http://github/robin900). Robin is experienced data warehouse engineer
with profound knowledge of OLAP and multidimensional modeling. Robin and his
team did a great job, contributed many new features and concepts.

We have quite a lot of new features and ideas thanks to Robin. Just to name a
few:

* new, completely rewritten Mongo backend
* authorization and authentication
* non-additive time dimension
* statistical functions

and many more.

Thanks and credit goes also to: [Brad
Willard](http://bradwillard.com/#photographer), Mathew Thomas, Ryan Berlew,
Andrew Bartholomew and Emily Wagner.

In addition, I would like to thank [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com) for
their kindness and for contributing their additions back to the community as
open-source.
