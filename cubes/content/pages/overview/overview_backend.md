## Backend and SQL ##

One of the backends shipped with the framework is SQL. It is powered by
the SQLAlchemy which supports multiple databases including PostgreSQL,
MySQL, Oracle, simple sqlite and many others.

Features:

Easy to prototype on top of existing, arbitrary star or snowflake
looking schemas.

Logical-to-physical mapping that supports multiple database schemas in
databases such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.

Denormalization by view or materialized by table.
