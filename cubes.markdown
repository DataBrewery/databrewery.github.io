Cubes is a light-weight framework for online analytical processing (OLAP). Main features are
multidimensional analysis and star and snowflake schema preparation and abstraction.

Cubes comes with a HTTP OLAP server Slicer which provides API for multidimensional data browsing.

Modular architecture of cubes allows to write any kind of OLAP backend. Currently provided backend is SQL
star/snowflake browser for ROLAP and Slicer backend as example for abstracting over another Slicer server.

_Focus on data analysis, not on physical data structure_

Framework features:

* **model** â€” Logical Model - description of how data are being analysed and reported, independent of physical data implementation
* **hierarchical dimensions** (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies, such as category-subcategory or country-region)
* **localizable metadata** and data Localization
