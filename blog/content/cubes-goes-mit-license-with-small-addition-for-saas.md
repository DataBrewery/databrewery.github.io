Summary: Cubes goes MIT license with small addition for SaaS

Cubes - The Lightweight Python OLAP Framework is now licensed under the MIT license with small addition. The full license is as follows:

The addition says, that if you use it as part of software as a service (SaaS) you have to provide the copyright notice in an about, legal info, credits or some similar kind of page or info box. That's all.

May it be like that? :-)

Updated Cubes sources [are here](https://github.com/Stiivi/cubes), as usual.

Enjoy.
