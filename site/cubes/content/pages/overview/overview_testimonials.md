Hi there. I lead the Data Engineering team at Squarespace. We've been using your Cubes framework as an OLAP layer for our MySQL data warehouse (and also for our mongodb-based datasets). Cubes is fantastic! It's much better, and much more evolved, than the Python-based relational OLAP tool we were developing in-house.
